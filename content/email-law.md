mywebclass.org implemented a robust email opt-in process to ensure that all recipients have given their explicit consent to receive marketing emails. The website also included an opt-out mechanism in all marketing emails, as well as a physical mailing address and accurate sender information.

Additionally, mywebclass.org used a reputable email service provider that complies with international email laws, such as GDPR in the European Union or CAN-SPAM Act in the United States.
